# LLM-Enhanced-Variable-Neighborhood-Search
LLMs can enhance Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) by 1) identifying promising applications, 2) automating neighborhood structure exploration, and 3) accelerating code development. This will reduce effort in applying VNS and enable researchers to leverage its strengths, leading to advances in optimization.
